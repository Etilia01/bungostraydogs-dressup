   <h1>About this Project</h1>
   <h3>This is a Fanproject based on the manga bungo stray dogs made by kafka asagiri and sango harukawa. It was made for the hackclub ysws fanpage !(Thats a kind of event for which teens make fun projects and get stuff relating to their projects! Its really cool). It had a deadline, and unfortunatly I got covid (in the year 2025?) and was knocked out for like 1.5 weeks (Shouldnt have started writing on ao3 again I guess) so I couldnt do diverse body types time-wise :(. YET!!! Because there will be updates or a v2 with even more cool clothing etc even if the event this was made for is over. I just like BSD way too much. But for now I need a break lol Im still kinda out of it.</h3>
   <h1>About the art</h1>
   <h3>The manga, when a new character is fully introduced, often features a character profile about said character. This game imitates the layout these profiles have, to make it so fans can make their oc's for the manga in its style.</h3>
   <h3>The style I tried to draw in for this is specifically harukawas earlier style, up until maybe the guild arc (?I think), as a really like it and wanted to learn how to draw in it for a long time now. Harukawas newer style is pretty cool too tho, especially the colored works, so I might do that one too at some point.</h3>

   <h2>Some notes about the style for anyone attempting similar:</h2>
   <p><li>Harukawa outlines lighter shadows with a slightly darker color. Took me way too long to notice, but it definitely adds depth.</li></p>
   <p><li>Folds are usually kinda triangular, but sometimes they overlay to make other shapes. Also, the triangles can have one or two kind of invertedly rounded sides?</li></p>
   <p><li>The darker elements like black hair usually have almost pure white highlights, while lighter colors have more greyish highlights or if theyre white-ish none at all. The rule for black stuff doesnt apply to akutagawa, as he is too emo for highlights (+hes got that contrast with jabot and hairtips going on, which would be undermined.)</li></p>
   <p><li>Harukawa draws characters eyes based on their own moral perception of themselves. Meaning, character thinks theire a bad person: iris pure black no highlights nothing. Characters who thinks theire a saint: white iris (With outlines!). Tho in fyodors case for example his eyes are also kinda glitched out, either because hes clearly not what he believes he is, or because hes just pretending to think hes in the right, thats up to the theorists to decide ;)</li></p>
   <p><li>Eyelids are sometimes drawn really high up, so make sure you dont mistake them for eyebrows when trying to learn the artstyle from references (Speaking from experience)</li></p>
   <p><li>When a characters face is drawn from a slight side angle, the line between chin and cheeks starting near the nose is slightly curved inwards.</li></p>
   <p><li>Think the nose is too far down? put it further down.</li></p>
   <p><li>Harukawa draws maincharacters very very thin (making sense regarding their backgrounds) so if you need kind of chubby but more so normal weight references, look at the cafe lady. And herman melville. Not the actual author. The character. I have references in this projects github in the folder "Profile collection" <a href="https://github.com/Etilia01/bungostraydogs-dressup">here</a></li></p>
