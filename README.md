A dressup game based on the early bungo stray dogs artstyle, made for fanpage (a hackclub ysws)

It took me so long drawing everything its insane. and here i thought harukawas artstyle would be easy to replicate.
Its not that polished because Im bad at css, but hey, at least that guarantees it isnt vibecoded.
